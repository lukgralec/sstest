# Using the Forum

To create a new topic, head to the front-end of the live website. Either log-in under your username, or, if you do not have one, register a new username.

## Registering a new username

Head to the public-facing website (the "frontend") and browse to the forum. Click on the "Register" link. You will be brought to a page where you can enter in your personal details. You may enter in your personal information in the fields.

Your nickname and any field you mark with a checkbox will be shown in your public profile on the forum. If you do not want a field to show up in your publicly accessible profile, make sure that the checkmark next to these fields are unchecked.

If you have an avatar (a small personal photograph or illustration which helps people visually identify you,) you may also upload it at this time, by either dragging and dropping an image into the "Drop Files" area or pressing the "From Files" button and choosing a .JPG, .GIF, or .PNG file from your hard drive. 

## Signing in with a username

To sign in with your username, head to the public-facing website (the "frontend") and browse to the forum. Click on the "Login" link. Enter your user "nickname" and the password you chose during registration.
